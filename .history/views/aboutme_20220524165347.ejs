				  		       am Amogh, born and brought up in Bandra. Thank you for allowing me to introduce myself. I scored 77% in my school at Little Flowers Montessori English Medium High School. I scored 77.7% in SSWN junior college, and currently, I'm in my final year at Xavier Institute of Technology and Science, Bandra.
				  		      
				  		      I believe my strength is my attitude, and I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and failure in a balanced way to move forward. I want to say that I don't leave any questions altogether as I believe in myself and my work.
				  		      
				  		      My short-term goal is to find a platform to expand my career and grow with the organization. And my long-term goal is to be the cause of the organization's success. Therefore, I always challenge myself to improve my progress and steady growth.
				  		      
				  		      That's all about me, sir. Thank you for providing me with such an excellent opportunity to introduce myself.
